# Getting Started
## Visualforce
Step 1. `git clone https://github.com/developerforce/Mobile-Design-Templates.git` or Download it as Zip by clicking on Download ZIP button. If you have downloaded it as a ZIP file, unzip it.

Step 2. You only need files in `common/js`, `common/css` and `common/images`, but for simplicity sake just zip the whole `common` folder.

Step 3. Upload it as static resource with name `Mobile-Design-Templates`.
 
Step 4.  Create a new Visualforce page.

Step 5. Reference the JS, CSS & Images in your Visualforce page like below:

```
   <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8"/>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, 
                                  minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"/> 
      <apex:stylesheet value="{!URLFOR($Resource.Mobile_Design_Templates, 
                'Mobile-Design-Templates-master/common/css/app.min.css')}"/>
      <apex:includeScript value="{!URLFOR($Resource.Mobile_Design_Templates, 
                'Mobile-Design-Templates-master/common/js/jQuery2.0.2.min.js')}"/>
      <apex:includeScript value="{!URLFOR($Resource.Mobile_Design_Templates, 
                'Mobile-Design-Templates-master/common/js/jquery.touchwipe.min.js')}"/>
      <apex:includeScript value="{!URLFOR($Resource.Mobile_Design_Templates, 
                'Mobile-Design-Templates-master/common/js/main.min.js')}"/>
   </head>
   <body>
     <!-- Copy Paste Template HTML's body here -->
   </body>
 
   ```
 
Step 6.  The downloaded repo has all the templates arranged in different folders. For example `List View` folder alone has `Standard.html`, `Tabbed.html`, `Picture.html` etc 6 templates.
